# Stylesheet Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** RetroEdit compiled binary was crashing with `StylesheetError: unable to read CSS file` when trying to load `retroedit.tcss`.

**Root Cause:** The CSS file path was hardcoded as `"retroedit.tcss"` in the application, which worked in development mode but failed in PyInstaller-compiled binaries because:
1. PyInstaller extracts files to a temporary directory (`sys._MEIPASS`)
2. The relative path resolution was incorrect for the bundled environment
3. The CSS file wasn't being found in the expected location

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic CSS Path Detection**
Added `get_css_path()` function in `retroedit/app.py` that:
- Detects if running in a PyInstaller bundle (`sys.frozen` and `sys._MEIPASS`)
- Searches multiple possible locations for the CSS file
- Falls back gracefully if CSS file is not found
- Handles both development and packaged environments

```python
def get_css_path() -> str:
    """Get the path to the CSS file, handling both development and packaged versions"""
    # Check if we're running in a PyInstaller bundle
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False) and hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
        # PyInstaller bundle - look in the temporary directory
        css_path = Path(sys._MEIPASS) / "retroedit.tcss"
        if css_path.exists():
            return str(css_path)
    
    # Development mode - look relative to this file
    module_dir = Path(__file__).parent
    css_path = module_dir.parent / "retroedit.tcss"
    if css_path.exists():
        return str(css_path)
    
    # Fallback to default name (will use Textual's default styling)
    return ""
```

### 2. **Updated RetroEditApp Class**
Modified `RetroEditApp.__init__()` to dynamically set `CSS_PATH`:
- Calls `get_css_path()` during initialization
- Sets `self.CSS_PATH` only if a valid CSS file is found
- Allows Textual to use default styling if CSS file is missing

### 3. **Enhanced Build Script**
Updated `build.py` to:
- Include hidden imports for `retroedit` and `retroedit.ui` modules
- Properly bundle the CSS file with `--add-data retroedit.tcss:.`
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly packaged

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation when CSS file is not found
- No crashes - application will use Textual's default styling
- Proper fallback behavior in all environments

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Development Mode ✅
```bash
$ python main.py hello.txt
# Works correctly with retro styling
```

### Compiled Binary ✅
```bash
$ ./dist/retroedit hello.txt  
# Now works correctly without stylesheet errors
```

### Help Command ✅
```bash
$ ./dist/retroedit --help
usage: retroedit [-h] [--encoding ENCODING] [file]
RetroEdit - A retro-style text editor
```
